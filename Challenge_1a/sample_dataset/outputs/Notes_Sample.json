    "title": "UNIT - V PRODUCTION & COST ANALYSIS INTRODUCTION: The production function expresses a functional relationship between physical inputs and physical outputs of a firm at any particular time period. The output is thus a function of inputs. Mathematically production function can be written as Q= f (A, B, C, D) Where “Q” stands for the quantity of output and A, B, C, D are various input factors such as land, labour, capital and organization. Here output is the function of inputs. Hence output becomes the dependent variable and inputs are the independent variables. The above function does not state by how much the output of “Q” changes as a consequence of change of variable inputs. In order to express the quantitative relationship between inputs and output, Production function has been expressed in a precise mathematical equation i.e. Y= a+b(x) Which shows that there is a constant relationship between applications of input (the only factor input ‘X’ in this case) and the amount of output (y) produced. IMPORTANCE: 1. When inputs are specified in physical units, production function helps to estimate the level of production. 2. It becomes is equates when different combinations of inputs yield the same level of output. 3. It indicates the manner in which the firm can substitute on input for another without altering the total output. 4. When price is taken into consideration, the production function helps to select the least combination of inputs for the desired output. 5. It considers two types’ input-output relationships namely ‘law of variable proportions’ and ‘law of returns to scale’. Law of variable propositions explains the pattern of output in the short- run as the units of variable inputs are increased to increase the output. On the other hand law of returns to scale explains the pattern of output in the long run as all the units of inputs are increased. ",
